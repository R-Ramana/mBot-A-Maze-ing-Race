# mBot-A-Maze-ing-Race
A robot that was calibrated to traverse a maze by responding to colour and frequency cues. Created using mBot (Arduino IDE).

# Overall Algorithm
When the button on the mBot was pressed, it immediately begins moving forward. Upon detecting a black strip below, it stops. The LED is activated, which then scans for a colour above the mBot. Depending on the colour it detects, apart from black, the mBotâ€™s motor will cause it to move in a certain direction. If the LED scans black, the microphone on the mBot will be activated. The mBot will then scan for an audio. If a high or low frequency is played, the mBot will again move accordingly. If no audio is played, i.e. the mBot has reached the end of the maze, a victory sound will be played. Infrared and Ultrasonic sensors were used to prevent the mBot from colliding with the boundaries and keep it on a straight path. You can find the flowchart in the  A-Maze-ing_Race_Report.pdf file.
